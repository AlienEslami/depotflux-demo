# Agentic Workflow Exports

This folder contains the n8n workflows used for the agentic day-ahead and real-time experiments.

## Files

- `day_ahead_workflow_prompt_analysis_baseline.json`: day-ahead workflow export. It loads settings, buses, chargers, trips, prices, and disturbances; builds an LLM pricing context; calls the optimization API; evaluates the result; and writes day-ahead plans and summaries.
- `real_time_final.json`: real-time workflow export. It loads day-ahead references, intraday price and energy disturbances, observed fleet state, and re-optimization history; decides whether to re-optimize; calls the real-time optimizer; and updates the rolling plan.

## Import Notes

The exports preserve n8n node structure, prompts, parsers, and connections.
Credential references and Google document/folder IDs have been replaced with
placeholders. Before running them in another n8n instance:

1. Reconnect Google Sheets, Google Drive, and OpenAI credentials.
2. Replace Google document/folder IDs with the replicated data sources.
3. Update HTTP request nodes to point to the deployed `app.py` or `app_rt.py` endpoint.
4. Confirm all sheet names match the workbook and Google Sheet names described in `docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md`.
